## SPRED - Sprite Editor

Simple indexed sprite editor.

This editor is for the 16 colour sprites supported by SuperTerminalMetal.

Features include a per sprite palette, two colours are always expected,
so the user can create 14 colours of their own.

Typical use would be retro bit pattern sprites.

SuperTerminalMetal supports a sprite layer that can display these sprites as a layer over the
various video modes.
